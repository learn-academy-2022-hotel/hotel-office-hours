Challenge: Dice Roller
As a developer, you are tasked with creating a dice application. The application will allow the user to role a standard six-sided dice and see the result of each roll. As the user rolls the dice, each roll gets logged creating a list of all the previous rolls.

When creating a project it is important to think about organization of your code. It is best practice to separate and compartmentalize all the actions in your code. The dice UI will be in its own component as will the roll log UI. App.js controls of all the data in state, renders the other components, and passes data to the dice and roll component.
